Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict which telecom customers are likely to "churn," or leave the service. By identifying these customers early, a company can take proactive steps to retain them. I built a machine learning model to tackle this problem, which is a great example of using data science to solve a real-world business challenge.

Key Goals of This Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I started by digging into the data to understand the factors that influence customer churn. This involved creating visualizations and looking for patterns.

Data Preprocessing: The raw data needed to be cleaned and prepared for the model. This included handling missing values and converting different types of data (like text) into a numerical format that the model could understand.

Feature Engineering: I created new features from the existing data to improve the model's performance.

Model Building and Evaluation: I built and trained a machine learning model to predict churn. I then carefully evaluated its performance to make sure it was accurate and reliable.

What's Inside the Notebook?
Telecome_Churn_Prediction.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file. It contains all the code, from data loading to model evaluation.

Data Analysis: You'll find a detailed walkthrough of the data, including visualizations that show relationships between different features and churn.

Model: The notebook uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn. I chose this model because it's known for being robust and accurate.

SMOTE Technique: A key part of this project was dealing with an imbalanced dataset (where there are many more non-churning customers than churning ones). I used a technique called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the data and improve the model's ability to detect churn.

Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

How to Run the Project
Clone this repository: git clone [Your Repository URL]

Install the required libraries: The notebook uses popular libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. You can install them using pip.

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Telecome_Churn_Prediction.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment.

Project Output
The final output is a machine learning model that can predict with a high degree of accuracy whether a customer will churn. This information can be used by the telecom company to offer special promotions or support to customers who are at risk of leaving.
